Three years ago, the world learned that harpies, centaurs, catgirls, and all manners of fabulous creatures are not merely fiction; they are flesh and blood—not to mention scale, feather, horn, and fang. Thanks to the \"Cultural Exchange Between Species Act,\" these once-mythical creatures have assimilated into society, or at least, they're trying.\r\n\r\nWhen a hapless human named Kurusu Kimihito is inducted as a \"volunteer\" into the government exchange program, his world is turned upside down. A snake-like lamia named Miia comes to live with him, and it is Kurusu's job to take care of her and make sure she integrates into his everyday life. Unfortunately for Kurusu, Miia is undeniably sexy, and the law against interspecies breeding is very strict. Even worse, when a ravishing centaur girl and a flirtatious harpy move in, what's a full-blooded young man with raging hormones to do?!\r\n\r\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno.\r\n\r\nThe Japan Ground-Self Defence Force immediately took action and pushed the fantasy creatures back to the \"Gate.\" To facilitate negotiations and prepare for future fights, the JGSDF dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the \"Special Region\" at the other side of the Gate.\r\n\r\nYouji Itami, a JSDF officer as well as a 33-year-old otaku, was appointed as the leader of the Team. Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography.\r\n\r\nThanks to their efforts in humanitarian relief, although with some difficulties they were gradually able to reach out to the locals. They even had a cute elf, a sorceress and a demigoddess in their circle of new friends. On the other hand, the major powers outside the Gate such as the United States, China, and Russia were extremely interested in the abundant resources available in the Special Region. They began to exert diplomatic pressure over Japan.\r\n\r\nA suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world—to the major powers it may be no more than a mere asset for toppling the international order. But to our protagonists it is an invaluable opportunity to broaden knowledge, friendship, and ultimately their perspective towards the world.\r\n\r\n(Source: Baka-Tsuki)",

            "synopsis": "In a world where children have a chance to develop special powers upon reaching puberty. Otosaka Yuu is one such child, choosing to live a relatively normal, satisfying life despite possessing an ability to control others’ bodies for a short period of time. One day, Yuu is suddenly approached by Tomori Nao, another child with special powers. Their meeting sets the stage for a story about growth, their many experiences, and a cruel fate that links the two. A routine life changes to one filled with the unexpected, a promise to return home becoming their only guide down an uncertain road. \r\n\r\n(Source: Aniplex of America)",
