Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive.

So when the decision is made to merge the elite Yuihime Girls' Private Academy and the coeducational Kagamidai Private Academy, everyone wants to take extra care in avoiding trouble while bringing the two Privates together. Therefore, rather than just sticking the Kagamidai boys into the Yuihime girls all at once, a plan is concocted in which a group of test males will be inserted into the Girls' Private Academy first. \nThus it is that poor young Shingo finds himself being thrown as a sacrificial lamb to the lionesses of Yuihime, who aren't exactly waiting for him with open arms. Will Shingo manage to survive the estrogen soaked death pit that is Yuihime? Can the girls learn to be more receptive to the boys? And just how long until something involving panties will cause emotions to flare, sparks to fly and the battle of the sexes to explode? \n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","show_type":"TV","started_airing":"2011-10-05","finished_airing":"2011-12-21","community_rating":3.5486757729226,"age_rating":"R17+","genres":[{"name":"Drama"},{"name":"Romance"},{"name":"School"},{"name":"Harem"}]},"rating":{"type":"advanced","value":"4.0"}},{"id":9131632,"episodes_watched":12,"last_watched":"2015-03-31T23:12:40.325Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T23:48:46.271Z","rewatched_times":0,"notes":null,"notes_present":null,"status":"completed","private":false,"rewatching":false,"anime":{"id":8850,"mal_id":26085,"slug":"military","status":"Finished Airing","url":"https:\/\/hummingbird.me\/anime\/military","title":"Military!","alternate_title":null,"episode_count":12,"episode_length":5,"cover_image":"https:\/\/static.hummingbird.me\/anime\/poster_images\/000\/008\/850\/large\/83e2e207gw1emjmf8u966j20hs0p5dic.jpg?1417877788","synopsis":"The story takes place during a conflict between the Krakozhia Dukedom and the Grania Republic.
