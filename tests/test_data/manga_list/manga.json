Kyousuke attempts to fish out the culprit who dropped the case by bringing up the topic of magical girl anime at the family dinner table. All that comes out is a strong negative reaction from his parents, especially his anti-otaku policeman father.\n\nThat night, Kirino bursts into Kyousuke's room and, in perhaps the first conversation she has initiated with him in years, says they \"have things to talk about.\" Kirino brings Kyousuke to her room and shows him an extensive collection of moe anime and lolicon bishoujo games she has been collecting in secret.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
