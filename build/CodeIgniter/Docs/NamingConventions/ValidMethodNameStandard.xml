    <![CDATA[
    Class names should always start with an uppercase letter. Multiple words should be separated with an underscore, and not CamelCased. All other class methods should be entirely lowercased and named to clearly indicate their function, preferably including a verb. Try to avoid overly long and verbose names.
    Methods and variables that are only accessed internally by your class, such as utility and helper functions that your public methods use for code abstraction, should be prefixed with an underscore.
